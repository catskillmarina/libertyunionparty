Campaign Statement of Marina Brown, 
Liberty Union Candidate for Vermont Auditor of Accounts.

The office of auditor is ostensibly non-partisan. The office of the auditor
ostensibly performs 3 types of audits. From the website for the office of the
auditor we see this description of the audits performed by the office of the
auditor: "Performance audits, the State’s financial statement audit (CAFR) 
and the State’s single audit (which looks at the usage of federal funds by 
the state)". I would add one more type of audit, a transparency audit that
would focus on turning Vermont from a state with very poor transparency to
a state where government business can be accessed on standardized portals for
every agency. The guidline for the work i would like to do would be transparency
for the government and privacy for the individual.

1) My office will push to make any organization that recieves even a dime of
state monies liable to public records requests.

2) I am in favor of removing most of the exeptions listed in the public records
law. It is in the publics interest to know what type of software is used to 
store private information. It is in their interest because the public needs to
know the security that protects private information. It is in the publics 
interest to know how expensive the software products are.

3) My office will push that the state use open source software wherever 
possible. Open Source software tends to be more secure than proprietary software
and it is free to obtain for the most part. 

3a) I will push that the state properly release improvements made on open source
software for the greater public good.

4) I will use technology in the service of transparency. I will use software
like securedrop of globaleaks to ensure that people feel safer reporting 
corruption,waste and worse problems in government and with government officials.

5) I will create a central portal or website for the public to access 
information released in the service of transparency.

6) My office will aggressively defend individual privacy including people
wanting to opt out of shared medical databases.
